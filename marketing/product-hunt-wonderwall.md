# Product Hunt Launch — WonderwallAi

## Tagline (under 60 chars)
Open-source AI firewall — block prompt injection in <2ms

## Description (under 260 chars)
WonderwallAi is a Python SDK and hosted API that protects LLM applications from prompt injection, data leaks, and off-topic abuse. 4 security layers, under 2ms latency, zero external API calls. MIT licensed. pip install wonderwallai.

## Maker's Comment

Hey Product Hunt! I'm Louis, and I built WonderwallAi after watching real users try to jailbreak my production chatbot.

I run a Shopify AI assistant called Jerry. Within the first week of going live, I saw prompt injection attempts, users treating it like a free coding assistant, and — the one that kept me up at night — someone managed to get the LLM to echo back an API key from the context window.

I looked at every existing solution. Hosted API scanners added 50-200ms latency and sent my customers' conversations to third-party servers. Heavy frameworks wanted to wrap my entire LLM pipeline. I just wanted a function that takes a message and says "safe or not safe" in under 5 milliseconds.

So I built my own. WonderwallAi is a 4-layer pipeline:

1. Semantic Router — cosine similarity against allowed topics using local embeddings. Under 2ms. No API call. This alone catches 90% of off-topic abuse.
2. Sentinel Scan — LLM binary classifier for sophisticated injection. Only runs after Layer 1 passes.
3. Egress Filter — catches leaked API keys, PII, and canary tokens in LLM output.
4. File Sanitizer — validates uploads by magic bytes, strips EXIF metadata.

The biggest surprise: off-the-shelf embeddings with a simple cosine similarity threshold catch 90%+ of attacks. I expected to need a fine-tuned classifier. Nope.

I'm 40, self-taught, building my first software products with the help of AI tools. WonderwallAi started as an internal component and became its own product because I realized every developer building LLM apps faces the same problem.

MIT licensed, 59 tests passing, on PyPI right now. Try it, break it, tell me what I missed.

## Key Features

- **<2ms Latency** — The semantic router runs entirely locally using lightweight embeddings. No external API calls on the fast path. Most attacks never make it past this layer.
- **4-Layer Defence** — Semantic routing, LLM-based injection detection, output scanning (API keys, PII, canary tokens), and file sanitization. Each layer catches different threat categories.
- **3 Lines to Integrate** — `pip install wonderwallai`, define your topics, call `scan_inbound()`. Works with any LLM provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Llama, Gemini, Ollama.
- **Canary Token System** — Inject a unique token into the system prompt. If it appears in the output, someone extracted your instructions. Hard block, zero false positives.
- **Open Source (MIT)** — Full SDK is free and open. Hosted API available for teams that don't want to manage infrastructure.
